Fn1 --  Brighten My Path and Darken Behind me should be combined.  It only makes sense to brighten an area when there's motion if after a certain theshold, the lights turn back off.  Merging these shouldn't be too difficult.  Alternatively, just delete those two and just use Light Follows Me.  Shouldn't require much tweaking to be useable as instead of them.

Fn2 -- Let There be light and Lights Off When closed should be combined with an optional fields.  Either you turn the lights on and off, you turn them on, or you turn them off.  No reason for two separate apps.

Fn3 -- Bob had me redo this app + a few features.  It's in Sprint.ly

Fn4 -- Incl option for push notifications

Fn5 -- Why not consolidate these?  It's just a notify or a text.  Same difference.  Just add an if statement or something.

Fn6 -- Pick one or the other.  Having two is confusing.

Fn7 -- Published twice.  Two different versions, two different userbases

Fn8 -- Merge these.  Just set it up to either feed your pet automatically or send you a reminder.  No need for two apps.

Fn9 --  Merge.
